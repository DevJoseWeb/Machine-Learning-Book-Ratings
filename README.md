# Book Recommendation Systems

This repository includes approaches to clean, transform and run recommendation algorithms on the [Book Crossing](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) data set. We used some of the data cleaning approaches found [here](https://github.com/tttgm/fellowshipai).

Algorithms used:

* [Collaborative-based filtering](https://github.com/GoldbergData/Machine-Learning-Book-Ratings/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project%20-%20UB%20and%20IB%20Methods.ipynb)

* [K-nearest-neighbor](https://github.com/GoldbergData/Machine-Learning-Book-Ratings/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project%20-%20kNN%20-%20KNeighbors%20-%20Supervised.ipynb)

* [SVD](https://github.com/GoldbergData/Machine-Learning-Book-Ratings/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project%20-%20SVD%20Method.ipynb)

* [Learn-to-rank](https://github.com/GoldbergData/Machine-Learning-Book-Ratings/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project-Learning%20to%20Rank%20Stock.ipynb)
